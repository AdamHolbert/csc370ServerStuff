            <p>We are a small company, located in the heart of Salt Lake City, Utah. Our focus is making sure that you purchase that
            the house that you want to fit your personal preference. On the day the buyer’s move-in, one of our real-estate agents and the buyer will be escorted by police officers to the home. The police officers will either calmly or use extreme methods to escort the previous household out of the house.

            <h2 class="Title"><b>Our Origin Story</b></h2>
              <p >A Couple Of Words From Tre'Maun Morrison</p>
              <p>On June 22nd, 2004, Adam and I were shopping for a house.
                 We saw a house that went beyond our needs and wants that met our budget.
                 Unfortunately, the house was occupied by a family of a husband and wife with their triplet girls.
                 We were emotionally distraught. Later that day, we vented to Jam about the house.
                 Jam gave us the best advice ever: “Just Take The House”. I took it, and hired a private real estate agent.</p>

              <p>He was able to find a loophole to let the us buy a house that wasn’t for sale.
                The agent went to the judge to see if this loophole was valid, and the judge ruled in favor of him.
                The judge notified a group of police officers and they escorted the people out.
                The family tried to file a lawsuit against us, but our real estate agent was able to display to them the loophole that was overlooked.</p>

              <p>So, the family had no choice but to withdraw their lawsuit; after that, Adam and I were able to take the house with just a signature on the dotted line.
                Later that day,  we told Jam how we were able to finesse our way around the standard mortgage contract.
                She then told us to make what we were able to accomplish into a business.</p>

              <p>And here we are now: “Me Casa Su Casa”.</p>
